# Scrybbling together

ReMarkable is about slow thought and deliberation.

It is connected to the internet, however! I believe we could easily make handwritten websites in this way.

Simply send an email to your-name@scrybble.ink

And the pages appear on your-name.scrybble.ink

## How does it work?
